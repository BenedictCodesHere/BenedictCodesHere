Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

My name is Benedict McElroy, an AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate - SAA-C03)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on upgrading my fullstack AWS-hosted application:

    [Cruddurclone](https://cruddurclone.com)

- You can find the architectural diagram of the application here:

- ðŸŒ± My growth is focused on deepening my understanding of AWS solutions and technologies, and improving my fullstack application-building skills in multiple programming languages.

- My immediate focus is on fixing some of the more fundamental issues which persist in Cruddurclone, such as:

    [Data discrepancies for `display_name`](https://github.com/BenedictCodesHere/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/issues/35) 
    
    [Data propagation issues for `ProfileAvatar`](https://github.com/BenedictCodesHere/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/issues/34)
